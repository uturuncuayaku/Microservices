## Warning
Usually you can attach a password to these certificates using the command line. These are password-less at this stage for development purposes. Storing them password-less has the ease of use of restarting the server easily without manual intervention using systemd on Linux.

# Certificate Generator

This project uses the OpenSSL library to generate:

- **Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)** for production use
- **Self-signed certificates** for local development and testing

## Purpose

The certificates generated by this tool will be embedded within a dedicated microservice responsible for:

- Handling secure user login
- Enabling TLS 1.3 encrypted communication between clients and server
- Establishing authenticated sessions for feature-level authorization

## Reason

These components are designed to support student portfolio projects at SNHU. By integrating secure communication into each microservice:

- Applications will be ready for real-world deployment
- Services can scale to support production-grade traffic and user authentication demands
